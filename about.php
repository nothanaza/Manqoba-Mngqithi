                            The Manboba Mngqithi Foundation was established with a clear purpose: to develop youth talent in the Harry Gwala District, with a special focus on Umzimkhulu. Our founder recognized the immense potential within these communities and the lack of opportunities available to young people eager to succeed.

                            Our initial programs in Umzimkhulu quickly gained traction. We launched skills development workshops, mentorship programs, and educational initiatives that resonated deeply with the youth. The success stories started multiplying - young people finding employment, starting businesses, and pursuing higher education.

                            As our work flourished, we began receiving requests from other communities across South Africa. It became clear that the challenges facing youth in Umzimkhulu were not unique - they were replicated in rural and urban areas throughout the country. Young people everywhere needed access to opportunities, mentorship, and support.
